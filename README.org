#+title: Bimmers NixOS Config

** What is this repository?
These are my dotfiles for my NixOS setup. BIG thanks to librephoenix. His modular code is astounding.

All I did was take a copy of his repo, and add JaKooLit's dotfiles. I wanted to just use the NixOS config
from JaKooLit directly but could never get it to work.

This is VERY MUCH a work in progress. When I bring up a new machine with a fresh NixOS system,
i will be using this command from librephoenix, but operating on this repo:

nix-shell -p git --command "nix run --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' github:bimmerr2019/NixOS-librephoenix-Jakoolit"
